# AssistAI - A ChatGPT Plugin for Eclipse IDE

AssistAI is an Eclipse IDE plugin that brings ChatGPT functionality into your development environment. This experimental plugin has been primarily tested with Eclipse 2023/03.


## Features

1. Refactor selected code snippets by asking ChatGPT
2. Generate JavaDoc comments for chosen classes or methods with ChatGPT's help
3. Create JUnit tests for selected classes or methods using ChatGPT's assistance
4. Engage in a conversation with ChatGPT about the content of the currently opened file
5. Fix compilation errors with ChatGPT's guidance
6. Copy code blocks generated by ChatGPT to the clipboard
7. Produce Git commit comments based on changes in staged files
8. Customize pre-defined prompts

You can also pose general questions to ChatGPT, just like with the regular ChatGPT interface.

## Context

The plugin leverages the OpenAI API to send predefined prompts to ChatGPT. These prompts include relevant context from your IDE, such as:

- File name
- Content of the opened file
- Selected class or method name

If you're not satisfied with the results, you can ask follow-up questions to ChatGPT. Your inquiries, along with the complete conversation history, will be sent to ChatGPT, ensuring more precise answers.

Use the "Clear" button to reset the conversation context. Press the "Stop" button to halt ChatGPT's response generation.

## Usage Examples

1. To discuss the class you're working on, select "Discuss" from the "Code Assist AI" context menu and ask any question about the code.

2. To refactor a code snippet, select it and choose "Refactor" from the "Code Assist AI" context menu.

3. You can also ask ChatGPT to document a selected class or method using the "Document" command:

4. Additionally, you can request ChatGPT to generate a JUnit test:

5. After staging all modified files, ask ChatGPT to create a Git commit message:

6. If you have errors in your code, ChatGPT can generate a patch to solve your issues. Select "Fix Errors" command, copy patch contents using the "Copy Code" button, and paste it to your project with CTRL+v, or you can use "Apply Patch" button that will open the patch import window. 

   The "Apply Patch" button is active whenever ChatGPT returns a *diff* code block. When interacting with ChatGPT (i.e. performing a code review) you can ask it to format its answers this way using a following prompt: "Return your answer in diff format using full paths".
