# AssistAI - A LLM (ChatGPT) Plugin for Eclipse IDE

AssistAI is an Eclipse IDE plugin that brings a Large Language Model (LLM) assistant (similar to ChatGPT) into your development environment. This an experimental plugin..


## Features

- Refactor selected code snippets with LLM
- Generate JavaDoc comments for chosen classes or methods with LLM's help
- Create JUnit tests for selected classes or methods using LLM's assistance
- Engage in a conversation with LLM about the content of the currently opened file
- Fix compilation errors with LLM's guidance
- Copy code blocks generated by LLM to the clipboard
- Produce Git commit comments based on changes in staged files
- Customize pre-defined prompts
- Using the built in tools (MPC) AssistAI can:
  - use JavaDoc or related source code to better understand the context
  - perform a web search using [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)
  - read a content of a web page
- Create contexts for the LLM that include source files or images 
- Use the vision model to discuss a image content
- Switch between defined LLMs
- Added support for interfacing with [Model Context Protocol (MPC)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) servers. The plugin is a MCP Client. You can interface your favorite MCP servers using **any** of the supported LLMs (not limited to Claude). 
- Now you can give control to LLM to modify your project files, access error logs, console output, and more... use Claude, sit back, vibe, and watch them tokens burn
- Discuss about math, or tabular data. The chat component now supports latex and table rendering
- Added tools that AI agents can use to execute and review JUnit tests
- [NEW] The AssistAI plugin is now a MCP Server accessible via HTTP. This means that you can configure Claude Code or Claude Desktop client to directly interact with your Eclipse IDE via MCP - this way you can let Claude use it's own planning, search tools and system tools, and still maintain the code by Eclipse (history, etc.). It also means that you don't need Claude API keys when using Claude Desktop.
- [NEW] New cached resource management and smart resource caching - LLM always sees the current version of files that are attached to the context (always up to date, no multiple copies)
- [NEW] In-text code completion with Alt+/ 


You can also pose general questions to LLM, just like with the regular AI chatbot interface.

## Context

The plugin leverages the OpenAI API to send predefined prompts to the LLM. These prompts include relevant context from your IDE, such as:

- File name
- Content of the opened file
- Selected class or method name

If you're not satisfied with the results, you can ask follow-up questions to LLM. Your inquiries, along with the complete conversation history, will be sent to LLM, ensuring more precise answers.

Use the "Clear" button to reset the conversation context. Press the "Stop" button to halt LLM's response generation.

Current LLM context resources are accessible with the *View > AssistAI > AI Resources*

### Smart Resource Caching

AssistAI remembers the files you've asked it to look at during a conversation. When you ask LLM to read the same file multiple times (for example, while iterating on code changes), it automatically keeps only the latest version—so LLM always sees your current code, not outdated copies. The plugin also detects when you edit files in Eclipse and refreshes its cache automatically. This means faster responses, lower token usage, and no confusion from LLM seeing old versions of your code mixed with new ones. Just remember save the file!

3. Click *Add*
4. Back in *Install* window, choose *AssistAI* from the  *Work with:* list
4. Select "Assist AI" from the plugin list and proceed to the next step by clicking the *Next* button
5. Accept any certificate warnings (note: this is a self-signed plugin, so you will be warned about potential security risks)

### Configuration

After installing the plugin, configure access to the **OpenAI API**:

1. Open *Window > Preferences > Assist AI* preferences
2. Configure your models *Window > Preferences > Assist AI* preferences > Models
   
3. Select the model you want to use from a dropdown list: *Window > Preferences > Assist AI* preferences. You can switch between the defined models here.

### Configuring MCP Servers

MCP servers provide LLMs with tools to interact with files, databases, and APIs. These tools can transform this plugin into an alternative to Cursor or MANUS. Several built-in MCP servers exist, such as DuckDuckGo search, web fetching, or Eclipse integrations, but you can easily add any MCP server that provides a stdio interface.

#### Adding the Filesystem MCP Server
To enable the filesystem MCP (e.g., [filesystem](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem)), which allows LLMs to read or modify files, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Preferences**  
   Navigate to *Window > Preferences > Assist AI > MCP Servers* and click **Add**.

2. **Configure the Server**  
   Fill in the configuration details:  
   ```  
   Name: server-filesystem  
   Command: wsl.exe npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem ${workspace_loc}  
   ```

3. **Optional Environment Variables**  
   Define environment variables if required (e.g., API keys).

#### Notes
- The `${workspace_loc}` variable specifies the workspace folder accessible to the MCP. When using WSL, this path is automatically converted to a Unix-style path for compatibility.  Other eclipse variables are available (`${project_loc}`, etc.)
- **Security Warning:** Use MCP servers cautiously, as they grant LLMs access to read or modify sensitive data in your project directory, which could be accidentally altered or deleted by the LLM.

### HTTP MCP Server - Exposing Eclipse Tools to External Clients

AssistAI now supports exposing its internal MCP servers (eclipse-ide, eclipse-coder, etc.) as HTTP endpoints. This allows external AI clients like Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any other MCP-compatible application to use Eclipse IDE capabilities remotely.

#### Enabling the HTTP MCP Server

1. **Open the Preferences**  
   Navigate to *Window > Preferences > Assist AI > HTTP MCP Server*.

2. **Configure the Server**  
   - Check **Enable HTTP MCP Server**
   - Set **Hostname** (default: `localhost`)
   - Set **Port** (default: `8124`)
   - Click **Generate** to create a new authentication token, or use an existing one
   - Click **Apply** to start the server

3. **Verify Server Status**  
   The **Server Status** section will show "HTTP Server is running" when active.

4. **View Enabled Endpoints**  
   The **Enabled Endpoints** section displays all available MCP servers exposed via HTTP:
   - `http://localhost:8124/mcp/eclipse-ide`
   - `http://localhost:8124/mcp/eclipse-coder`
   - `http://localhost:8124/mcp/duck-duck-search`
   - `http://localhost:8124/mcp/webpage-reader`
   - `http://localhost:8124/mcp/time`
   - `http://localhost:8124/mcp/memory`

#### Integrating with Claude Desktop

To connect Claude Desktop to your Eclipse HTTP MCP Server:

1. **Locate Claude Configuration File**  
   Open the Claude Desktop configuration file:
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. **Add MCP Server Configuration**  
   Add entries for each Eclipse MCP server you want to use:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "eclipse-ide": {
         "command": "wsl",
         "args": [
           "npx", "-y", "mcp-remote", "http://172.24.208.1:8124/mcp/eclipse-ide", "--allow-http"
         ]
       },
       "eclipse-coder": {
         "command": "wsl",
         "args": [
           "npx", "-y", "mcp-remote", "http://172.24.208.1:8124/mcp/eclipse-coder", "--allow-http"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Notes:**
   - Replace `172.24.208.1:8124` with your actual hostname and port
   - Use `wsl` command on Windows to run npx through WSL
   - On macOS/Linux, use `"command": "npx"` directly
   - The `--allow-http` flag is required for non-HTTPS connections
   - Add authentication header if using auth token (see below)

3. **Using Authentication Token**  
   If you configured an authentication token in Eclipse, add it to the args:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "eclipse-coder": {
         "command": "wsl",
         "args": [
           "npx", "-y", "mcp-remote", "http://172.24.208.1:8124/mcp/eclipse-coder", 
           "--allow-http",
           "--header", "Authorization: Bearer de34508b-e69b-4d93-8910-470c61c9f098"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Restart Claude Desktop**  
   Close and reopen Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect.

#### Use Cases

With HTTP MCP Server enabled, external AI clients can:

- **Read and modify Eclipse project files** using `eclipse-coder` tools
- **Access project structure and properties** using `eclipse-ide` tools
- **Run and analyze JUnit tests** in your Eclipse workspace
- **Read compilation errors** and get context about your code
- **Format code** according to Eclipse formatter settings
- **Access JavaDoc and source code** for better context understanding

This feature enables powerful AI-assisted development workflows where Claude or other AI assistants can directly interact with your Eclipse IDE environment.

#### Security Considerations

- **Local Network Only:** By default, the server binds to `localhost`. Only expose to external networks if necessary.
- **Authentication Token:** Always use an authentication token when exposing the server beyond localhost.
- **Firewall Rules:** Ensure your firewall allows connections only from trusted sources.
- **HTTPS:** Consider using a reverse proxy with HTTPS for production use.
- **Access Control:** The AI client will have full access to all tools exposed by the enabled MCP servers.


### Add ChatGPT View

Add the *ChatGPT View* to your IDE:

1. Open *Window > Show View > Other*
2. Select *ChatGPT View* from the *Code Assist AI* category
